# Setting Up Clerk Webhooks

For advanced user management, you can set up webhooks to sync user data with your backend:

1. Go to the Clerk Dashboard
2. Navigate to "Webhooks" in the sidebar
3. Click "Add Endpoint"
4. Enter your webhook URL (e.g., `https://your-api.com/webhooks/clerk`)
5. Select events to listen for:
   - `user.created`
   - `user.updated`
   - `user.deleted`
6. Copy the signing secret and store it securely in your environment variables

This allows you to keep your database in sync with Clerk user events.
