# Testing Your Authentication Flow

1. Start your application with `npm start`
2. Navigate to `/auth` to see the welcome screen
3. Test the sign-up flow for both provider and receiver roles
4. Test the sign-in flow with the created accounts
5. Verify that the sidebar shows the appropriate options based on user role
6. Test the protected routes to ensure they're only accessible to the right user types
7. Test the sign-out functionality

If everything works correctly, users should be able to:

- Sign up as either a food provider or receiver
- See different navigation options based on their role
- Access only the appropriate sections of the application
- Sign in and out successfully
